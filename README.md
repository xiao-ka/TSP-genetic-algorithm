# GeneticAlgorithm
An implementation of TSP by Genetic Algorithm in Java.
## Details
* Use Object-Oriented to implement.
* Divide this algorithm into four Classes: __GeneticAlgorithm__, __SpeciesNode__, __SpeciesNodeList__ and __Constant__.
* __GeneticAlgorithm__: controls the whole algorithm's life cycle and do some genetic operation including select, cross, mutate.
* __SpeciesNode__: contains the sequence of gene, the length of route and fitness of this species.
* __SpeciesNodeList__: represents a list(group) of species
* __Constant__: contains the data of map, the max length of every group of species, the max number of generations, the probability of cross, mutate and so on.
